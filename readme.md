## UCSC-Class-Search

A texting interface powered by the Twilio SMS API that lets UCSC students register for open/close/waitlist notifications for an upcoming course. The app stores student data by the incoming phone number and lets students query which courses they are currently subscribed to and the statuses of each of these subscribed courses (available seats, open/closed, instructor, location...).
